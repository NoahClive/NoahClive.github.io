            One of the first "projects" almost every computer science student works on is the "Hello World" program. Although incredibly basic, it is usually the first step to a long journey in coding. The first language I began learning was Python!

              The first website I created wasn't for a computer science class! This project was created for my digital imaging class in my freshman year. The project was mostly focused on design over the function of the website but you can view it through this <a href="/Pages/Graphic Design Website/index.html">link!</a> <br>

              This project was for my Intro to Computer Organization class. We had to use the Multimedia Logic program to create a functional stoplight using logic gates and flipflops.
